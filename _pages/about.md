Welcome to Heqing Huang's homepage!

I am an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science, [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/)! Previously, I was a postdoc research fellow in the [AST Lab](https://ast.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich, advised by [Prof. Zhendong Su](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/). I am also fortunate to obtain my Ph.D. supervised by [Prof. Charles Zhang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~charlesz/) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research focuses on software security, especially leveraging program analysis techniques to ensure software security rigorously.
Specifically, my research takes advantage of both static and dynamic program analysis techniques as complements to address deficiency problems in existing vulnerability detection methods, such as fuzzing (S&P'20, 22, 24ab, TDSC'23, FSE'21, ISSTA 21), symbolic analysis (ISSTA'20, OOPSLA'21, ASPLOS'24a, ASPLOS'25), and memory sanitization (ASPLOS'24b). 

**I am serving as the PC for [CCS 2025](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/), [ISSTA 2025](https://conf.researchr.org/home/issta-2025), as well as co-chairing [SPLASH 2025](https://2025.splashcon.org). Look forward to seeing your submission!**

## Funding and Cooperation
Our work **Pangolin** published in **S&P 2020** has been successfully deployed in the Huawei tool-chain
and detected more than **1000+** crashes/bugs!
We have thus received the **Huawei Distinguish Collaborator 2021** award! This is also reported by HKUST [CSE department](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/News/Huawei2021/)!

## Bugs Hunting
Our self-built fuzzing framework (Integration of S&P'20, 22, 24, TDSC'23) has discovered more than 1000 bugs in the widely-used commercial and open-source projects, with over 100 of them assigned with CVE IDs and over $10K bounties. A partial of vulnerabilities detected can be found [here](https://outstanding-hydrogen-2d1.notion.site/Trophies-aef45e1245a64528bd8ec111b475e03b).
We also list the bugs found specifically for SMT theorem provers [here](https://smtfuzz.github.io).
