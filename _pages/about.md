Welcome to Heqing Huang's homepage!

Currently, I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Hone Kong University of Science and Technology.
My research direction is application security and I am very keen to improving all kinds of vulnerability detection methods such as fuzzing, symbolic execution by using various program analysis techniques. 


* NEWS!  
  * Our directed fuzzing work has been accepted by [S&P 2022](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2022/index.html)!
  * Our work for improving symbolic abstraction gets accepted by [OOPSLA 2021](https://2021.splashcon.org/track/splash-2021-oopsla)!
