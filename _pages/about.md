Welcome to Heqing Huang's homepage!

I am a Postdoc research fellow supervised by Dr. Charles Zhang at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My research direction is application security. I am very keen to improve all kinds of vulnerability detection methods by using various program analysis techniques, such as fuzzing and symbolic execution. Especially, I prefer to combine the two state-of-the-art techniques, static analysis, and dynamic fuzzing, to improve the effectiveness.


**I am on the job market for faculty positions starting from 2022/2023!**

* NEWS!  
  * Received Huawei distinguished collaborator award on deploying Pangolin (S&P 20)!
  * Our directed fuzzing work has been accepted by [S&P 2022](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2022/index.html)!
  * Our work for improving symbolic abstraction gets accepted by [OOPSLA 2021](https://2021.splashcon.org/track/splash-2021-oopsla)!

## Bugs Hunting
Tens of CVEs and thousands of bugs have been detected by our fuzzers.
A partial of vulnerabilities can be found [here](https://outstanding-hydrogen-2d1.notion.site/Trophies-aef45e1245a64528bd8ec111b475e03b).
We also list the bugs found specifically for solvers [here](https://smtfuzz.github.io).

## Funding and Cooperation
Our work **Pangolin** published in **S&P 2020** has been successfully deployed in the Huawei tool-chain
and detected more than thousands of crashes/bugs!
We have thus received the **Huawei Distinguish collaborator 2021** award!
